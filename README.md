# JUSTLEND DAO INTRO

JustLend DAO is a TRON-based decentralized lending protocol that provides a distributed and secure market where users can receive loans and earn interest at a low trading cost.&#x20;

JustLend DAO protocol is a TRON-powered money market protocol aimed at establishing fund pools whose interest rates are determined by an algorithm based on the supply and demand of TRON assets. There are two roles within the protocol, namely suppliers and borrowers. Both of them interact directly with the protocol to earn or pay a floating interest rate. 2 On JustLend DAO, each money market corresponds to a unique TRON asset such as TRX, TRC20 stablecoin (e.g. USDT) or other TRC20-based tokens, and entails an open and transparent ledger that records all transactions and historical interest rates.
