# Announcement on Adjusting the TRX Market Interest Rate of JustLend

Dear user:

&#x20;

The latest data of the TRX Market shows that the TRX utilization reaches 100%, According to the JustLend protocol, it is normal that the supplied user cannot withdraw assets and the user cannot borrow new assets when the Token utilization reaches 100%. Users can withdraw and borrow normally after the Token utilization falls below 100% (Either the total supply increases or the total borrow decreases).

&#x20;

Since the current interest rate of the TRX market is kind of low, in order to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the TRX market, JustLend will increase the base interest rate of the TRX market in the near future. Please pay close attention to the changes of the TRX market and ensure the safety of your assets.

&#x20;

Thank you for your support!
