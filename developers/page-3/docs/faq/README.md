# Introduction to JustLend

## What is JustLend?

JustLend is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion. Please join the JustLend community Discord server; the JustLend team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use JustLend.

## Why JustLend?

JustLend Protocol has been audited and secured. The protocol is completely open source, which allows anyone to interact with a user interface client, API or directly with the smart contracts on the TRON network. Being open source means that you are able to build any third-party service or application to interact with the protocol and enrich your product.

## How do I interact with JustLend protocol?

In order to interact with JustLend protocol, you simply deposit your preferred asset and amount. After depositing, you will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing assets allows you to borrow by using your deposited assets as a collateral. Any interest you earn by depositing funds helps offset the interest rate you accumulate by borrowing.

## What is the cost of interacting with JustLend protocol?

Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for TRON Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity.

## Where are my deposited funds stored?

Your funds are allocated in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open source, formally verified and audited by third party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool on-demand or export a tokenised (aTokens) version of your lender position. aTokens can be moved and traded as any other cryptographic asset on TRON.

## Is there any risk?

No platform can be considered entirely risk free. The risks related to the JustLend platform are the smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process). Every possible step has been taken to minimise the risk as much as possible-- the protocol code is public and open source and it has been audited. Additionally, there is an ongoing bug bounty campaign live and running.

You can find additional risk and security related information in the risk framework and security and audits sections.
